# web-scraping-python


### Install

This project requires **Python 3.6** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/)
- [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/)
- [python-firebase](https://pypi.org/project/python-firebase/1.2/)


You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer installer and not the Python 2.7.

### Code

Template code is provided in the `scraping-candidatos.ipynb` notebook file. 

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the project directory `/` and run one of the following commands:

```bash
ipython notebook scraping-candidatos.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook scraping-candidatos.ipynb
```

This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your browser.
